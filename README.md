# Totally Useless Programming I

This is a small script that will convert your Chrome bookmarks to YAML. It can
sort them (slowly right now) and remove any bookmarks before a certain date.

Just export your chrome bookmarks to HTML format and set bookmarkFileName in config.js to 
point to your exported bookmarks. **Make sure not to check your bookmark file(s) into git**.
